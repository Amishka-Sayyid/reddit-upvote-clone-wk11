# (Optional)

üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

    for this submission i am really grateful to connor and mohammed. they helped me with deploying to vercel i learnt from them how to debug the developer setting and adding the deployed url there.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

    i managed to learn how to fork, clone and push changes to own github.
    not much time to be able to work on more features.

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

    deploying on vercel needed to change the developer setting to include the url of the deployed page.
    passing the username prop i needed to encode the uri  and decoding the param to access the username only then was i able to fetch user details for the user profile page.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
